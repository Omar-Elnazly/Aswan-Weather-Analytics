**Repository Version by my pair Ezzeldin Salah:**  
https://github.com/huevvn/SolarPowerPredictionPhase2

This repository presents a comprehensive pipeline for **solar power prediction using meteorological data**, including data cleaning, extensive feature engineering, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling for both **classification and regression**.

## Project
Overview
Environmental and climate analysis plays a critical role in understanding regional weather patterns and supporting decision-making in agriculture, renewable energy, and urban planning.

This project analyzes **Aswan weather data (Egypt)** using **statistical analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and multiple machine learning models**.  
The primary goals are:
- Understand climate behavior in one of Egypt’s hottest regions
- Analyze relationships between meteorological variables
- Classify temperature levels
- Predict solar power generation
- Compare multiple ML models and evaluate overfitting


## Dataset Description
- **Location:** Aswan, Egypt  
- **Type:** Time-series weather dataset  
- **Source:** Egyptian Meteorological Authority (2022)

### Main Features
| Feature | Description |
|------|-----------|
| AvgTemperature (°C) | Daily average temperature |
| Humidity (%) | Relative humidity |
| Wind (m/s) | Average wind speed |
| Pressure (hPa) | Atmospheric pressure |
| Solar (PV) | Solar power indicator |

### Engineered Features
- `Temp_bin`: Low / Medium / High temperature classes  
- `Humidity_bin`: Low / Medium / High humidity classes  


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dataset inspection and sampling
- Missing value checks
- Column removal (`Unnamed`, `Date`)
- Temperature & humidity binning
- Summary statistics
- Distribution analysis
  

## Statistical Analysis
- Summary statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
- Covariance matrix + heatmap
- Correlation matrix + heatmap
- **Hypothesis Testing**
  - Independent **T-Test**
  - **ANOVA**
  - **Chi-Square Test**
- Correlation insights between weather variables


## Data Visualization
- Temperature distribution
- Temperature vs humidity scatter plots
- Temperature across humidity levels (boxplots)
- Correlation heatmaps


## Feature Engineering
- Train-test split (80% / 20%)
- Standardization using `StandardScaler`


## Machine Learning Models

### 🔹 Dimensionality Reduction
- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)
- **LDA** (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
- **SVD** (Singular Value Decomposition)

### 🔹 Classification Models
- Naive Bayes (+ Cross Validation)
- Decision Tree (Entropy)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev)
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network (Feed Forward)
- Neural Network (Feed Back – custom implementation)
- Bayesian Belief Network

### 🔹 Regression Model
- Linear Regression for **Solar(PV)** prediction


## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrices
- Cross-validation
- ROC Curves (multi-class)
- Regression metrics:
  - MAE
  - RMSE
  - R²
  - Willmott’s Index
  - Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency
  - Legates–McCabe Index


## Overfitting Analysis
Comparison between training and testing accuracy for:
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- LDA
- KNN

**Result:**  
Most models demonstrate **good fit** with minimal overfitting.


## Key Results
- **Best Classification Accuracy:** Decision Tree (100%)
- **Strongest Correlations:**
  - Temperature ↔ Dew Point
  - Humidity ↔ Pressure
- Solar power prediction remains challenging due to nonlinear relationships
